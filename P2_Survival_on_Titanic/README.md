#### Summary: 
This analysis explored the factors in "Policy", "Wealth", "Location of cabin", "Family member" and "hometown" to determine the survival keys on Titanic. 

The analysis shows that factors such as being 1st class passengers, having family aborad, embarking from Cherbourg also help increase the surivival, but the main survival factors are gender and age. The survival rate of male from 1st is lower than female from 2nd and 3rd class strongly supports class is not the determining factor for boarding the lifeboat. The higher survival rate for 1st class probably benifited from its closer location to the boat deck (first come, first serve).

Due to the lack of complete passenger data, the analysis might not present the whole truth. In particular, the imcompleted cabin data (only about 25% passengers having cabin data and 90% of them are in 1st class) very likely bias the results about the effects of location on survival.
