#### Summary: 
This analysis shows that people mainly use the bike system from Monday to Friday. However, only in Palo Alto, the frequency of bike usage is similar on weekends as week days. Although the usage frequency is similar on weekdays and weekends in Palo Alto, the patterns of using time are very different. On weekdays, people bike in two main periods: 8-10 and 17-19, very likely for commute. On weekends, people bike mainly after lunch and before dark, probably for leisure activities.

The other cities also show the same weekdays and weekends patterns. But people in San Jose seem to start their trip to work a bit earlier (peak at 7-9 compared to the other cities peak at 8-10). This might imply different age of users for the city: for example, the main users for San Jose are students and for other cities are adults.
