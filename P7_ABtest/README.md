# Use A/B test to decide the launch of online experiments 

* **File:** ABtest.ipynb
* **Project goal:** Transform an idea into a well defined design of experiment, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment to reduce early cancellations without affecting the paid students in the online courses in the online courses.
 
* **Data source:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MYNUtC47Pg8hdoCjOXaHqF-thheGpUshrFA21BAJnNc/edit#gid=0 and https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu5u9GrybDdska-ljPXyBjTpdZIUev_6i7t4LRDfXM8/edit#gid=0

* **Programming:** Python 

#### Summary: 
The experiment significantly (both statistically and practically) reduced enrollment but failed to reach practical significance in keeping the current paid students. 

I suggested a new experiment by adding a new button "see how other students get the nanodegree" to the main page of enrolled users. Only enrolled users can see the button. If they click the button then they can watch the video/article from students sucessfully finished the nanodegree with different backgrounds. In the videos, these students will talk about what kind of difficulties they encountered in their nanodegree study, how they deal with all challenges, how they plan their time to finish the nanodegree and how the skills learned from the course are used in their current lives... This implementation can help the current enrolled students to learn from students who finished the nanodegree successfully and having similar background to overcome the frustrations as well as get motivated.
