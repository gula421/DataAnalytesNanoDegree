# Analyze [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect)
 
The time required to read wrongly coded words (e.g., "red" printed in green) is longer than to read correctly coded words ("red" printed in red). This is called "Stroop effect" in psychology, showing interference in the reaction time of a task. Try the [experiment](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/ready.html) yourself!

#### Summary:
This analysis shows that the time required for incongruent tasks (read wrongly coded words) are longer than that for congruent tasks (read correcly coded words). The best people can achieve in the incongruent tasks is aorund the time of the worst gruop in the congruent task. In general, people perform well in the congruent task can also perform well in the incongruent task
